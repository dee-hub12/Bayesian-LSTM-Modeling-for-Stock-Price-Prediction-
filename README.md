Investors and financial professionals in today's dynamic stock markets attach great significance to precise forecasts of stock returns. This emphasis is not only on accurate forecasting models but also their reliability. While conventional machine learning models can predict nonlinear datasets with high accuracy, they often overlook uncertainties in their predictions, leading to unreliable outcomes. This study employed the Bayesian LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for stock price prediction and examined its performance with that of the conventional LSTM model. The findings revealed that the Bayesian LSTM model produces better results than the conventional LSTM model considering the  R-squared, MAPE (Mean Absolute Percentage Error), and RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) values. The Bayesian LSTM model acknowledged the presence of inherent uncertainty in the underlying data and refrained from exhibiting excessive confidence in its predictions, having a confidence level of 48.67% in predicting the S&P 500 data for the study. This study provides a more reliable approach to stock price prediction to help investors and financial professionals make informed decisions.
